                                                          Password-Generator
 
This project consists in create a passaword generator using JavaScript features to achieve the proposed task.
The basic securtiy conditions for the password generator be created are as follows:
Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    *Length of password
    *At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
    * Lowercase
    *Uppercase
    *Numeric
    *Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
    The first steps were to create three different arrays filled with lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters.
    After the arrays creation the next step was to create one string concatenation using the code ".concat". Then a function to prompt the user and show then password criteria/ options.
    The next function were to generate a random number from the concatenated arrays. Another function to create a password user input "Please type your password".
